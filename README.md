# APB-React-Portfolio

## Description

My motivation to build this project was to learn how to use REACT by building my portfolio page.

The reason to build this project was creating a portfolio page where clients can see my personal information and the most important projects that i have done.

The main lesson of this project was how to make the contact form to work with email js.
